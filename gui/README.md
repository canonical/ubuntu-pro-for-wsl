# Ubuntu Pro For Windows - User Interface

This is the territory of the GUI part of "Pro for Windows".

It is a Flutter monorepo split into separate packages:

- p4w_gui - the application;
- p4w_ms_store - a Flutter plugin to expose the MS Store WinRT APIs to the Dart land.

Even though this project is only meant to run on Windows, the packages listed above must be able to run on Linux for testability purposes.
