wsl-pro-service (0.1.18) plucky; urgency=medium

  * Pin Go toolchain to 1.23.8 to fix the following security vulnerabilities:
    - GO-2025-3563, GO-2025-3447 and GO-2025-3373 (LP: #2106757)
  * Allows the service to quit for longer period of time if the Windows agent
    is not reachable.
      - resulting in less logging to system journal.
  * Removes workaround for livepatch no longer needed since pro-client v35
      - systemd service is more confined again.
  * Prevents unnecessary re-registration with Landscape
      - by passing the CLI flag --register-if-needed to landscape-config.
  * Upgrades various golang dependencies.
