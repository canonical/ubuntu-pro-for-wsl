wsl-pro-service (0.1.18~24.04.1) noble; urgency=medium

  * Upgrade to upstream version 0.1.18  (LP: #2106757):
      - Allows the service to quit for longer period of time if the Windows agent
        is not reachable, resulting in less logging to system journal.
      - Removes workaround for livepatch no longer needed since pro-client v35
      - systemd service is more confined again.
      - Prevents unnecessary re-registration with Landscape, by passing the 
        CLI flag --register-if-needed to landscape-config.
      - Upgrades various golang dependencies.
