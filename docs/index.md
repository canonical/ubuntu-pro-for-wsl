# Ubuntu on WSL

Windows Subsystem for Linux ([WSL](https://ubuntu.com/desktop/wsl)) enables
developers to run a GNU/Linux environment on Windows. The Ubuntu distribution
for WSL is tightly integrated with the Windows OS, supporting features
including remote development with popular IDEs and cross-OS file management.
Ubuntu can be used as a terminal interface on Windows and can also
launch Linux-native graphical applications.

Ubuntu Pro for WSL is an in-development automation tool for managing
instances of Ubuntu on WSL. If you are responsible for a fleet of Windows
devices, Pro for WSL will help you to monitor, customise and secure Ubuntu WSL
instances at scale.

Ubuntu on WSL provides a fully-featured Ubuntu experience on Windows, suitable
for learning Linux, developing a personal open-source project or building for
production in an enterprise environment.
