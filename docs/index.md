# Ubuntu on WSL

Windows Subsystem for Linux ([WSL](https://ubuntu.com/desktop/wsl)) enables
developers to run a GNU/Linux environment on Windows. The Ubuntu distribution
for WSL is tightly integrated with the Windows OS, supporting features
including remote development with popular IDEs and cross-OS file management.
Ubuntu on WSL provides a productive terminal environment that can also be used
to launch Linux-native graphical applications.

Ubuntu Pro for WSL (UP4W) is a powerful automation tool for managing instances
of Ubuntu on WSL. If you are responsible for a fleet of Windows devices, UP4W
will enable you to monitor, customise and secure Ubuntu WSL instances at scale.
