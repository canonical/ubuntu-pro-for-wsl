**Ubuntu Pro for WSL** is a Windows application that automates the
attachment of your Ubuntu Pro subscription. It solves the problem of needing to
manually Pro-attach each new Ubuntu instance created on a Windows machine when
you want the security benefits of Ubuntu Pro. For organisations, it enables
automated Pro-attachment at scale for fleets of devices.

## Basic usage of Ubuntu Pro for WSL

Find and install the Ubuntu Pro for WSL application in the Microsoft Store.

After installation, open the application and enter your Ubuntu Pro token.

> [!TIP]
> If you are a system administrator, you can also use the Windows registry to
> add a Pro token. After the Ubuntu Pro app has run at least once, the relevant
> key will be available as `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Canonical\UbuntuPro`. The
> Pro token can be added as data for the `UbuntuProToken` value.

Now, all instances of Ubuntu on WSL will be automatically Pro-attached on your machine.

You can confirm this in any Ubuntu instance with:

```
pro status
```
